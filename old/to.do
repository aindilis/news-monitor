(check out GALE (global autonomous language "exploitation"))

(Tracks the news, applies TDT, cross document entity resolution.)
(Setup a news mining system, that tracks what is going on in the news)
(Mine news networks for good works, like "tiff", but don't use
 them aggressively like they do)
(Write a system that figures out plans based on what happens in
 the world, and monitors news streams
 (but doesn't believe them, remember "hearsay is dead evidence")
 and helps to proact/react.)

(look at some of the news aggregation sites)

(We want to start a news archive, which tracks what people are
 writing, for analysis.  We needs must analyze the arguments of
 whosoever happens to be in opposition to us, not for the
 purposes of rebutting them (necessarily), but to understand
 their position as well.  We need to be able to analyze them
 however for factual closure, as well as for semantic closure,
 and act according as the truth imports.
 (here's the article  that I was reading when  I had the thought,
  also  we   want  to  track  authors  (even   pennames,  etc)  and
  publications,  dates  and times,  find  existing databases  where
  possible:     http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/04/22/8448.
  Do sentiment analysis and full textual, anaphora, etc, analysis.)
